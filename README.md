# Statistical_Analysis

 Statistical analysis is all about describing and summarizing data. It uses two main approaches:

>The quantitative approach describes and summarizes data numerically.
The visual approach illustrates data with charts, plots, histograms, and other graphs.

There are many Python/R statistics libraries out there and some of which I have learnt is as follows:

1.ThinkPlot

2. NumPy to deal with arrays

3. Pandas to deal with Data Frames

4. Matplotlib is a third-party library for data visualization.

<h1>Overall Learning</h1>
I have taken Introduction to Statistics in my undergrad as well as Grad university. The overall outcome I have learnt are as follows:

•Basic concepts of data analysis and statistical inference, applied to 1-sample and 2-sample
location problems, the analysis of variance, and linear regression.

•Probability models and statistical methods applied to practical situations and actual data
sets from various disciplines.

•Elementary statistical theory, including the plug-in principle, maximum likelihood, and the
method of least squares.

• Build many Python projects based on diffferent dataset and learn different data distribution plotting in R as well.
